/* 9. Find All Happy Numbers in a Range
Problem Statement:
In a small village, people celebrate their happiness by performing a ritual with numbers. A
number is considered "happy" if the process of repeatedly summing the squares of its digits
eventually leads to 1. For example, the number 19 is happy because 1^2+ 9^2 = 82, 8^2 + 2^2=
68, and so on, eventually reaching 1. Your task is to find all happy numbers in a given range.
Can you help the villagers find their happy numbers?
Constraints:
‚óè The range is between 1 and 10^4.
Sample Input:
1, 20
Sample Output:
[1, 7, 10, 13, 19]
Explanation:
The happy numbers between 1 and 20 are 1, 7, 10, 13, and 19. */
